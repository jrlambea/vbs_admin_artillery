vbs_admin_artillery
===================

Small tools in vbs for Windows domain/local admins. It could be useful as examples for other projects or little snippets, these are the _almost_ small scripts that contains this repository:

- _Get-InstalledApps.vbs_ (wmi query with `WbemScripting`)
- _Remove-InstalledApps.vbs_ (uninstall automatically applications through `wmi` [not reliable method])
- _Remove-InstalledApps.v2.vbs_ (uninstall automatically applications using `msiexec` and querying `wmi` [best option])
